# assemble-boilerplate-blog [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/assemble-boilerplate-blog.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/assemble-boilerplate-blog)

> Assemble boilerplate with the essential middleware, helpers, templates and (opinionated) configuration necessary to easily create a blog with Assemble.

**Heads up! This project is under construction!** If you take a look around you'll see multiple (duplicate) config files (assemble.js, gulpfile.js etc). We're just playing around with the config until it feels right. We'll end up with one config file and we'll add some examples for other configs.

## Install
Install with [npm](npmjs.org):

```bash
npm i assemble-boilerplate-blog --save-dev
```
