# assemble-blog [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/assemble-blog.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/assemble-blog)

> Assemble plugin to assist with generating blog pages for posts and archive lists.

## Idea
This is a propsal for a blog plugin that will use a struture to find
blog posts and generate the correct metadata for each page to add them
to common blog collections (e.g. archives, posts, etc...). This will
also add the correct collection objects to the context to ensure that
the proper archive index pages are created.

## Install
Install with [npm](npmjs.org):

```bash
npm i assemble-blog --save-dev
```
